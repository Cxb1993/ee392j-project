Content-Based Occlusion-Adaptive Mesh Design for Motion Compensation

Stanford EE392J class project by Gunnlaugur Þór Briem; March 13, 2000.

This is ancient, and glancing over it I'm not struck with any particular
pride in it :) but somebody asked for it and I found it, so here it is.

The two files `read_frame_qcif.m` and `read_frame_sif.m` came from the
course instructors, John Apostolopoulos and/or Susie Wee; I imagine they
will not mind me including these files here (Google finds them elsewhere
on the internet anyway), but they do not say anything specific about
licensing terms and of course I cannot speak for these authors.

The other files are, to the best of my shaky knowledge (13 years after
the fact) my own work; I grant license (and disclaim any warranty) for
those files as detailed in `LICENSE.txt`.
